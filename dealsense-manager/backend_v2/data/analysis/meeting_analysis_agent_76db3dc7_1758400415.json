  "summary": "The meeting transcript discusses the challenges of the current education market, particularly for startups, and explores potential solutions. Harsh Bansal raises concerns about the effectiveness of existing online education platforms, citing \"Physics Walla\" as an example that focuses heavily on theoretical knowledge for exams like JEE and NEET, but neglects practical project-based learning. Bansal highlights that many students, even in their third and fourth years of university, struggle with project work due to a lack of practical guidance and motivation, especially in an online learning environment where student engagement is low. The conversation then shifts to a potential business strategy involving partnerships with \"tier three\" universities in India. The idea is to leverage a third-party system to supplement university curricula, which are often rigid and difficult to change. The proposed approach involves targeting students in these universities, promoting project-based learning, and providing step-by-step guidance to help them build practical skills and projects. This is seen as a way to improve their employability and placement rates, as companies tend to recruit more from universities with higher placement records. Bansal also shares some financial data for their venture, stating that in their first year on the market, they achieved a revenue of \"around three point two crore\" with a \"GM percent\" of sixty-two percent. However, the transcript does not provide specific details about the product or service being offered, nor does it offer a clear \"ask\" or call to action.",
